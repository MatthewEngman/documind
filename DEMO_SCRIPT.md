### 2. Document Upload Demo (1 minute)
- Visit live demo URL
- Drag and drop a sample PDF
- Show real-time processing progress
- Point out vector generation step
- Highlight Redis storage of chunks + metadata

### 3. Semantic Search Demo (2 minutes)
- Search: "API security best practices"
- Show instant, relevant results
- Point out similarity scores and highlighting
- Try another search to demonstrate caching
- Show sub-100ms cached response time

### 4. Redis Innovation Showcase (1 minute)
- Switch to Analytics tab
- Point out Redis memory usage
- Show vector search statistics
- Highlight cache hit rates
- Demonstrate multi-model usage (JSON + Vectors + Caching)

### 5. Technical Highlights (30 seconds)
- "This uses Redis 8's native Vector Sets"
- "75% memory reduction with quantization"
- "Production deployed with auto-scaling"
- "Real-world enterprise application"

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Talking Points
