# 5-Minute Demo Script for Redis AI Challenge Judges

## üé¨ Live Demo: https://documind-ruby.vercel.app

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
"DocuMind is a production-ready semantic document search system powered by Redis 8's Vector Sets. It transforms static document storage into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base with real-time analytics and enterprise-grade performance."

### 2. Document Upload Demo (1 minute)
- Visit live demo URL: https://documind-ruby.vercel.app
- **NEW UI**: Point out the improved vertical layout - Upload at top for primary action
- Drag and drop a sample PDF or document (supports up to 10MB)
- Show real-time processing progress with dynamic timeout calculation
- Point out vector generation step using OpenAI embeddings
- Highlight Redis storage of chunks + metadata + base64-encoded vectors
- **Show Documents section**: Full-width display below upload (no more cut-off!)

### 3. Semantic Search Demo (1.5 minutes)
- **NEW UI**: Search interface now positioned below Documents for better workflow
- Search: "America" or "artificial intelligence" or "business strategy"
- Show instant, relevant results from actual uploaded documents
- Point out similarity scores (typically 32-36% with optimized 0.1 threshold)
- Highlight text snippets with search term highlighting
- Try another search to demonstrate semantic understanding
- Show sub-second response times with optimized fallback vector search

### 4. Real-Time Analytics Showcase (1.5 minutes)
- **NEW UI**: Analytics positioned side-by-side with Search for balanced layout
- Point out **LIVE DATA**: 40+ total searches, 13% cache hit rate
- Show **System Status**: OpenAI (Green ‚úÖ), Redis (Green ‚úÖ), Local Model (Red ‚ùå)
- Highlight **Vector Memory Efficiency**: 75% reduction vs traditional DBs
- Show **Redis Vector Sets**: 11 quantized embeddings stored
- Demonstrate **Redis Memory**: 3.90M with 29 keys
- **Real-time updates**: Watch analytics change as you search

### 5. Technical Excellence (1 minute)
- "This uses Redis 8's native Vector Sets with production fallback"
- "Optimized similarity threshold (0.1) for better recall"
- "Enterprise security - no exposed credentials in public repo"
- "Real production deployment on Google Cloud Run + Vercel"
- "Industry-standard UX with progressive disclosure pattern"
